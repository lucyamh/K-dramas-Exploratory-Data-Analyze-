# K-dramas-Exploratory-Data-Analyze-

Hi, my name is LUCYA.
This is my first portfolio and I excited to upload my first project to Github.
Honestly, I was really confused and I didn't know what kind of the project that I should choose to be my first portfolio.
People said,choose the project that you like the most and finally Korean Drama is my choice.

Korean Drama(K-Drama) is the most popular drama in the world, especially in Asian.
As the fans of K-Drama, I would like to analyze data of K-drama which I found in Kaggle. The dataset contains top 250 K-Dramas. It has 17 columns and 251 rows.

This is the detail of the dataset:

1. Name           : The title of the dramas
2. Aired Date     : Date from when to when it was first aired
3. Year of release : The year it was first released.
4. Original Network :The cable television channel or the platform where it was first released.
5. Aired On : The days of the week when the show was running when aired.
6. Number of Episodes : The total number of episodes in the k-drama.
7. Duration : The duration of each episode of the k-drama in hours and minutes.
8. Content Rating : The suitable audience rating.
9. Rating : The rating of the k-drama at the time of building the dataset. The ratings are as per votes from users of the MyDramaList
10. Synopsis : The Synopsis or Plot of the K-drama.
11. Genre : The genre of the drama
12. Tags : The tags of the drama
13. Director : Director of the drama
14. Cast : Actor and actress of the drama
15. Screenwriter : Screenwriter of the drama
16. Production Company : Production company that produce the drama
17. Rank : rank of the drama

I hope this project is useful for other data scientist beginners in learning and I'm always open to advice on how to improve my skill.
